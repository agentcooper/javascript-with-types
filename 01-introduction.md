## Note on TypeScript Playground

TypeScript's official playground comes with too relaxed options â€“ does not have `strict` enabled by default. This causes many surprises when testing out code. I've built a [different playground](https://agentcooper.github.io/typescript-play) which has all strict settings enabled by default.
